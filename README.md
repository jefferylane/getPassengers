# GetPassengers App

## App Description

This android application features two activities, a Main as well as a secondary activitiy called GetPassengers. Upon starting the application, you will see the Main activity featuring a textview title, a button to launch the secondary activity, and another text view to be updated with a list of passengers. After tapping the "GET PASSENGER LIST" button, the GetPassengers activity will launch, showing a new screen with edittext fields for first and last name and phone number. once you enter the information you can tap add passenger to append a new passenger object to the list. Once you're done, you can use the "RETURN LIST" button to send the data and a count of passengers back to the main screen, which will then parse the data, converting each passenger to a string, and adding it to the text view on the main screeen.

## Challenges

Although the application was straightforward, i got caught up after naming the getList function slightly incorrectly, causing no data to return. After correcting this issue, everything was smooth sailing. 

## Learnings

This exercise helped me familiarize myself with the Intents system in android, creating them to return data to other activities and such.

## Improvements

This app could use some way to prevent users from entering empty passengers, additionally, it could go for some cosmetic improvements and idk yet but maybe theres a smoother way to handle the entry of users. Maybe all from one screen (that defeats the purpose of the lesson though.)
